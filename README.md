### 1. 📝 Post Service
- **Function**: Handle user posts including OCR-extracted bill data and ML-based authenticity verification.
- **Flow**:
  1. User uploads a bill image
  2. OCR extracts data (Product, Date, Amount, Company)
  3. Post-authentication ML model verifies authenticity
  4. Image is stored in Cloudinary; metadata in MongoDB

### 2. 🔔 Notification Service
- **Function**: Real-time alerts for post status, review replies, etc.
- **Flow**:
  1. Triggered upon key events (new post, status update)
  2. Uses Socket.IO for push delivery
  3. REST API available to update and fetch read/unread status

### 3. 💬 Chat Service
- **Function**: Chat system for branch-consumer communication.
- **Flow**:
  1. Consumers or branches initiate chat by `chatid`
  2. MongoDB stores chat history
  3. Route: `http://localhost:8080/dhruvishah/dmart/chat/{chatid}`

### 4. ⭐ Review Service
- **Function**: Submit and manage product/branch reviews.
- **Flow**:
  1. Post-auth consumers can leave a review
  2. Admins respond through dashboard
  3. Reviews are analyzed for insights

### 5. 🔐 Auth Service
- **Function**: Manage user authentication and roles
- **Flow**:
  1. Registration/Login with OTP or credentials
  2. JWT issued on successful auth
  3. Role-based access (Consumer / Branch Admin)

### 6. 🏠 Home Service
- **Function**: Landing page and user-friendly home UI
- **Flow**:
  1. Fetches trending posts, shortcuts, and recent activity
  2. Dynamic data from Post, Review, and Chat services

### 7. 📊 Analytics Service
- **Function**: Data-driven insights for admin users
- **Flow**:
  1. Aggregates Post, Notification, Review data
  2. Generates metrics and sentiment analysis
  3. Displays on dashboard in chart form

### 8. 🧮 Dashboard Service
- **Function**: Admin control center
- **Flow**:
  1. Shows analytics, chat panel, review moderation
  2. Uses ShadCN + Tailwind + Socket.IO for UI
  3. REST hooks to all other services

### 9. 📌 Status Service
- **Function**: Monitor status of posts, reviews, and chats
- **Flow**:
  1. `/status` API serves real-time state
